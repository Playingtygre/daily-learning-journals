## LJ Code 301 - Day 1

This first week was really good! I had the chance to meet with new cohorts and fellow night studnets. I think the night course pace is really good for me because I think I personally a very slow learner. Every day my attempt is to learn at least 2 to 3 things new. On one of the first days we had done SMACCS which was separating the css files into several different groups. On the following days we had learned about mobile first develpemtn using goodgle development tools. JB had shown us a way to start a live-server using our laptop and look up a dns.

Also, we had learned the difference using the variable var , let and const. "Var" states the namming variable, "let" sets somewhat of a global variable within a small block, and "const" is a variable that is a set golbal variable that dose not change.

We also had to do coding challenges with the group that was really fun as well. 

I enjoyed the pace of the class and the allowance that JB gives to the students in order to finish their assignemtns.
