"# LJ Code 301 - Week 2"

This week was an intresting one!.... Push as much as we can for two lectures;
So this week I have exposure to two diffrent items; handle bars. js and
more advace jquery DOM manipulations. 

handle bars . js has the ability to use a template {{insert here }}
with the .js file and html file along with a object literal make the code
alot cleaner.Part of the two labs we had today was creating jquery from a blog website 
and adding it to create more dyamic code in order to show list items of both authors
and categories. I had worked with alicia during this and she seems very smart and 
well informed about what we needed to do on the lists. However I was able to keep
basic structor about our syntax and fill in the blanks, which was my contribution.

Overall this week went great I was able to learn 5 things about how to utilize two diffrent libaries
which will make my code more effeicent more later on.
