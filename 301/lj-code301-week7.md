# LJ Code 301 - Week 7
Week 7 is already here!, finishing up the week before project week. 
This past week we had to work on our booklist application which involves single page applications and API's. I was exposed to alot of new material which invloves the GET, and PUT methods in ther server.js files. I need to practce this more and more. JB had shown us using his books-ahoy application to connect using the heroku SQL database which I believe in an external API that allows to store extra books. 

This week was also really good because I was able to work with devin again and we were able knock out our booklist application. This helped solidify some learning elements for me. We had done alot more to build out our application and routes.js files and have a basic understanding for the files of MVC module, View, and Controller.
