# LJ Code 301 - Week 6

Week 6 more than half way there..
Alot was learned from SQL as a whole, I still do not know the deep syntax for SQL but I do understand the overall principle, pretty much we are learning how to use exclusively javaScript to push completely to a live-web server along with delopying a small database to go along with it. I feel as tho I need to practice more SQL commands and learn the overall better understanding of PSQL shell. 

This weekend was another push because we had to learn heroku web hosting server in all its glory, luckly for me I was able to be paired with a Devin a fairly smart individual to carry the us in the group. I feel as tho I am getting alot out of this because I realize that I need to practice the sntax more properly in order to become a more effective developer.
