# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

  3rd day is a charm. Today was mostly about working on the about me profile.
Included in todays lab was the profile with list items and at least ten different items.
  Originally I had thought I knew about CSS but I was very wrong. I know the basics of it and It seems as though I am starting to fall thru. Changing certain elements is very hard and challenging. I realize now that I must attempt to push thru the labs and projects to at least keep up with the workload. I'm glad that they have unlimited submitting for the projects along with Teacher Assistance feed back because I am able to redo most of it.

Today was a struggle as well because it involved array with strings and a loop which I have not deal with in a while.  I have only practiced simple loops and strings so we are starting to push forward with the whole (var =0; i>10; i++);

I also got some help from my co workers. to my best ability I was only able to help them with git hub.
But..... there was an older lady today that I did help her with part of her java script prompt with mad me happy.
