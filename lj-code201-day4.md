# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Thursday, made it more than half way thru the first week !!!!
Remembering about coding is getting better with me. I still don't remember a lot of the items that I have practice during the pre-work part.

Functions are what we covered today, we stared to write functions into question prompts on screen, a lot was technically review but the lab assignment was able to work with another person named Brian whom helped with coding.

Brian and I were able to work together and switch all of my for loops into functions and I was able to finish at a reasonable time.  This started to make me realize the stuff that I had remembered.

...Practice makes me perfect
....I'm swimming in practice
