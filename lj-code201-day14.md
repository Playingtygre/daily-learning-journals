# LJ Code 201 - Day 14

Today was a lot of information packed about other hidden functions and methods found within Javascipt itself. I did not like the way all the information was smashed into almost an hour block. It is was like learning about the parseInt or splice of an Array and then finding out that there are fifty other methods that are built around that; almost a waterfall of information was thrown at us and I am still am attempting to drink from it.

Ugh, but today was great because I got to work with Ariel again, we were able to write some code together that allows the users from the bus mall to place orders and make information decisions about them.
Anyway, hopefully I will be able to catch up my bus mall status later on this weekend and get my grades up and running.
