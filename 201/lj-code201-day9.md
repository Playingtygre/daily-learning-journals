# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Thursday, Today was more of a catch up day, completed my table; however still I am missing my form for input for posting another table.

Topics covered in class today were the layout of most HTML webpages and psuedo coding.

We also did a calculator application today that I learned was very instresting.
In class we had used a for loop to ask if two numbers were addition if not then the next line was subtraction if not then go on into division if  true then perform the function of the two different number. This proved to be a real interesting way and response to code a built in calculator.

Overall I found that today was successful was able to actually finish my coding and get home in a timely manner.

I am hoping that this weekend I am able to complete most of my assignments and
return in whatever I ended up not doing.
