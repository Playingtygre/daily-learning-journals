# LJ Code 201 - Day 20

So Today is the Final day, Last night I had stayed up late Re taking the course 301 and
gotten a better grade. The lack of sleep and pushing out assignments is goanna finally over.

Project day started off very easily, as a matter in fact another group I had found out that pretty
much all agreed to come in a bit later.

Some of the other groups projects were very inspiring especially the last two which were games.
The ghost town website was very inspiring in the fact everything was visually pleasing.

The other group was the scrabble game which had a array of words that was taken from the official
array of scrabble words.

After the projects were done I and went around and had asked the group the basic things that they had done, also I had found out that some of the other groups had slight conflicts as well but not as much as ours.

Over all project; week did well for us; I am hoping that we were graded nicely and as a group we
all think we hit the goals set in the requirements.
