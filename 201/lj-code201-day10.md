# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Friday, The weekend!!! This was a great assignment for the lab, I got to work with someone whom I normally don't work with named Matt.

Today was also exciting because I had gotten been able to sit thru the 401 students projects, and watched four different mock full stack websites.

One was a gourmet chef food webpage that delivers home cooked meals.
The second one was a web page for automatic skateboard boards;
The third was about getting code fellow students as a profile in a web page.

If I remember correctly the webpage with home cooked meals; they used a something called Mongo DB which allowed for updating images to the blanket website.
I have heard of mongo DB before, but I've never seen it or used it till now.
This kind of gives me a little bit of aspect to work with and want to work on.
Goals :: learn about NoSQL and Mongo DB;
