# LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Monday the third week, I want to finish my time here strong. I feel better and a bit better knowing how to utilize the skills, creating the elements and calling the children.

This past weekend I spend about 12 hours sitting coding attempting to push to complete the tables; I also had went to a hackers meet up and got a bit of help from a person who is from Australian working for amazon, he had told me a simple advice of even tho the workday is like eight days you really only are productive about three hours of it. 

I had also met another self study person who had done about five years of coding and who ended up taking a guided course thru a different code camp.

 Today, we had learned about the coding of the videos and sound.
