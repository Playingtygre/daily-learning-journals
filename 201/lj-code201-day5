# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Well I got and finished the first week!. These are almost ten hour study days.
Today was very hard for me because I had never learned a new concept before.
the lab assignment had something as follows....

function test(a,b,c){
  return [a,b,c]
}

test (4,2,3)[0];

I ended up having to copy someone else's code because I could not figure out how
to display the results correctly when calling the function in the return.
I may have seen this before but I don't remember every practicing it.

Thankfully, one of the TA Lizebeth was able to help me understand the concept
a bit better. As well as an older lady sitting next to me, she was able to
walk me line by line to explain the code and what I am performing.
