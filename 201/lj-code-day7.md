# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Today, was all about tables, I wasn't able to do as much as I wanted.
Nick had done something with the salmon cookies code-review, he had asked the group to build random lists and place java script inside the html indexes.

So, we went around the room and I was able to tell that several folks were just like me in the fact that we were lost when it came down to understanding displaying the random variables that were hidden in the JavaScript.

It was also a neat and interesting to see how other people understood code and were attempt at making the class code to work.

During the lab assignment, I was able to ask two people that I do not usually talk to in order to help me understand some parts of code that were written incorrectly. They were very helpful in fact that I realized what I needed to look for in my own code especially debugging aspect of it.

Another noted fact that today was a bit confusing for me, I had read some of the goals incorrectly and needed a better grasps of what I am attempting to code.

I'm actually stating to realize how long I can sit down in one setting and code for a few hours while time passes away.
