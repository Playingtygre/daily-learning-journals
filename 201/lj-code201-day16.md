# LJ Code 201 - Day 16

So initially there were some hiccups and some very high tensions. This is a very robust group
of smart thinking individuals. This is also a very dynamic and its members that are in this group
that have many different ideas in the way which we approach things.
There also may have been one or two times that several members in our
group has fought and gotten into an argument.

My group dynamic is strange; there are two individuals whom are both stubborn and
strong minded get into small verbal arguments. This is almost evident by other groups whom
noticed us raising our voices.

I'm not the one whom decides to get confront and individual; but when we all attempt
at being a democracy one individual votes their option get throw out, individuals
feel the need to comment on each other and check out.
