# LJ Code 201 - Day 12

Learning, journal day 12 almost halfway thru the first week.
Code review about some of the key concepts are still cluttered in my own mind. A random picture maker followed by a random clicker, I must write my own pseudo code more clearly and follow thru with it.

I don't think its nothing new but the logic behind the java script is much harder than I had expected. Originally I had written my own basic code that was Keeping Simple is Stupid; which would have worked if I didn't have any integrity restraints against it but I didn't add all the logic to add a counter for all my images and non- displaying images that I am not allowed to use again.

Much of my code needs to be re written.
