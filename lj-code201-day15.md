# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

Friday of third Week, its a great start; finally being able to play catch up on the Bus-mall stuff. Today was also an interesting assignment about
learning more about git hub and its ability to be a version file control; this is quick practice about what we might have conflicts later on during our project week.

Part of my group we will be coming up with ideas about what types of question to ask member and star a mock draft of our frame work.
