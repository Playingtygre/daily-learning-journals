# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Things are starting to heat up, I didn't start off the week strong as I was hoping because I had to drill this weekend and fly out. But it did make me realize how much time is very precious. Spent at least a few hours testing CSS
out while flying back to Cleveland, didn't realize how much I had already known.

Today things were different was forced to learn DOM / API without much known about it. Used more document.getElementID('id') way more than what I wanted. This is something I need to practice more if  I wanted to be a better programmer.

I also felt very useless today; the lab was the salmon cookies and I was only able to figure out 1/4 of the problem before I had gotten stuck. Most of my classmate were already ahead of me thinking about other ways around the solution.

This was one of the times that I truly felt like I didn't know what I was doing and I was unable to help anyone, not even myself.

However in light of all the coding errors; I learned today to get help from my co students. Ariel was very helpful and patient with me in teaching me how to understand and pull from the DOM.

I just wish sometimes that I may be able to help other students around me.
