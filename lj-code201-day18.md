# LJ Code 201 - Day 17

So today was an improvement overall, I believe that our group started out
struggling with various interpersonal conflicts and I feel as tho we have actually
resolved them. This is also an interesting day today because we had performed
something called a mob code; which we had two navigators, one white board person,
and one driver. This proved to be especially value because all of us were able to get
some serious coding time in to use and work on a extremely large function which
collects tally marks points based on the type of answer a person gave.

We pretty much did this the entire time we were there in the smaller student class rooms.
for (user.name[i]=== 'answer') {
  buddy.[i].tally; i++
}.
