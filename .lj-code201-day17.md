# LJ Code 201 - Day 17

So today was a better day that we had done to help preform some interpersonal
conflicts. This Morning we had done a stand up and talked about each other
and how we had felt the previous day which was Monday and it turned out great.

The morning started off by going around the table and talk about each other and
how we felt, about the other day our conflicts and how we could go about resolving
them and how we would attempt at helping each other out.

I had felt especially proud because we I had told them yesterday that I would
voice my own options better and make an attempt at doing things that I normally
 would not perform. Today turned out more positive than expected.

 I had volunteered with the initial scoring of the function and so I had written the
 first 'logical portion' which is counting the number of top choice matches and
 pushing them into and array. I did not start off coding very well but I was able
 to obtain sleight of hand when someone else was looking over my shoulder.
