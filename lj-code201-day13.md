# LJ Code 201 - Day 13

Wednesday Mid Week of the third week, we had learned about local storage using localStorage.SetValues();

Today was also a good exercise about learning how to store variables and to
retrieve data. This is very similar done in the way of event listeners.
This seems very easy instructor Nick but for some of us folks it may take some time for me to develop my listeners skill set.

Today was a good day as well because we got to work in pair programing with the different people. I ended up getting matched with Ariel and we worked very well together. What made me understand alot of it today was that we went thru her code line by line and listened and looked at all the different aspects of what she did.

Later on when I get back home to Indy I need to brush up on JSON and jquery and learn and realize more about them. This might give me a leverage more on the 301 course when I am able to take into account the bigger picture of overall things.
