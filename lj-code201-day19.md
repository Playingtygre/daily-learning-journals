# LJ Code 201 - Day 19

The Last Thursday Before project day. Today we had a good morning flow up until
the afternoon. We had done our group stand up around 9am which was good up until about
we all decided to perform CSS together as a group.

In theory this is a good idea having all of us give input about CSS. This would have
allowed everyone to voice there own option about stuff, but the also caused a major time
set back.

So, In my group I have two strong members with different viewpoints.
Attempting to allow multiple people to can create conflicts. Which did end up
happening to have a conflict.  Three of us out of the four had decided that
one way to competed CSS was agreed upon but another member was highly dissatisfied
and had wanted another way to preform some certain CSS styling over all others.
We attempted to act like a democracy but on that hour it ended up badly and one
member got verbally upset and ended up walking out of the room after myself and another
member attempted to resolve the conflict.

One thing to realize that various people have different ideas about but sometimes
other feel suborn don't want to change.

Nick, had to untimely intervene and have the group sit down for about 2 hours which
ended up taking away from our progress that we had made the previous days. We did end up spending about three hours doing some small changes that allowed the group to each voice their options
and finally were able to practice performing a walk thru about what to expect during our
showcase projects.
