# LJ Code 201 - Day 16

So, today was an interesting start, got together with our group and started to hash
out different ideas and committed to different step.

This week I started off weak feeling that I might have failed this course.
I am not sure if I can finish strong with the group.

Currently there were some interpersonal problems that happened but I feel as tho we
have hashed it our properly, but we should have settled down property.
