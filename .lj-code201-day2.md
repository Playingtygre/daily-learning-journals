# LJ Code 201 - Day 02

My first entry journal, I also had started another private journal for day one as
well. Most of the items we have covered today was review. Linking html, css, and
java script pages all together.
Even before class started I had done as much prework and learning about html, javascript, and css as possible which did help me.
I ended up helping two of my class mates out,  one who didnt know much about css
and another with debugging image loading.

I need to definitely gain the practice with working in terminal more.
Currently I use a windows operating system. Maybe I could buy a mac or use linux!
